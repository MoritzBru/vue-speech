# vue speech

> Using Vue, Vite, VueUse, TypeScript & Tailwind

This is a simple tool that uses speech synthesis and speech recognition.
It can listen to you and if it recognises the _catch phrase_, it will read you a sentence from the list of _sentences_ and then listen again for your answers and list them out to you.

Inspired by [Ioana Orca's](https://github.com/IoanaOrca) meditation sessions.
